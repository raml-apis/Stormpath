Configuring connector

- In order to run these notebooks you have to register a StormPath account and obtain API Key as described in [REST API quickstart guide](http://docs.stormpath.com/rest/quickstart/). Your apiKey.id and apiKey.secret are considered as username and password respectively.
- Specify username and password in the Authentication tab of the HTTP Request Configuration dialog. Alternatively, you may set corresponding attributes right in the XML file.

Running connector
