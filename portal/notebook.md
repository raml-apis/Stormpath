The API notebooks are all executable! Hit "enter" in any code cell to execute it (and all cells before it that have not executed yet), or scroll to the bottom of the notebook and click "Play notebook". For more information, see [http://apinotebook.com](http://apinotebook.com).

#Considerations

- In order to run these notebooks you have to register a StormPath account and obtain API Key as described in [REST API quickstart guide](http://docs.stormpath.com/rest/quickstart/). Your apiKey.id and apiKey.secret should be used as username and password in the authentication process.
- The notebook "Accounts" requires you to enable email verification for a certain directory. See the notebook itself for details.
